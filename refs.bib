abstract={In the architecture of GSM-WLAN interworking, there are drawbacks
related to authentication efficiency for processing loads in the RADIUS server.
Therefore, this paper presents two authentication schemes, based on the EAP-SIM
mechanism, to improve the authentication efficiency by balancing the processing
loads among the RADIUS server and APs. The performance evaluation on the
average authentication session time and the processing time for the
conventional EAP-SIM authentication schemes and the proposed authentication
schemes shows the efficiency improvement of the proposed schemes. It can save
about 19\% authentication processing time for the proposed full authentication,
and about 75\% authentication processing time for the proposed iterative fast
authentication scheme.},

        abstract={In next generation networks one of the most challenging issues is the definition of seamless and secure handoffs in order to assure service continuity. In general, researchers agree on the use of EAP as an authentication framework independent of the underlying technology. To date, efforts have focused on optimizing the authentication process itself, leaving out other relevant but sometimes important aspects like privacy. In this paper we present a solution that provides a lightweight authentication process while preserving user anonymity at the same time. The goal is to define a multi-layered pseudonym architecture that does not affect the fast re-authentication procedure and that allows a user to be untraceable. Taking as reference our previous work in fast re-authentication, we describe the extensions required to support identity privacy. Moreover, results collected from an implemented prototype, reveal that the proposed privacy-enhanced fast re-authentication scheme is attainable without significant cost in terms of performance in 4G foreseeable environments.},

ors ship virtual private network (VPN) clients as part of operating systems (OSs) or as free downloads, and even Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) devices enab
le the use of \{VPN\} and Terminal Services software. In terms of network security, there are three methods of passing communications to a centralized network
: on-site connection to the local network, remote access, and messaging. Remote Access Servers (RAS), Network Access Servers (NAS), VPNs, authentication serve
rs such as RADIUS, TACACS, and TACACS+, and other technologies have been designed to keep out unauthorized users, but channeling these wirelessly and over ope
n air is a completely different thing. \{VPNs\} use secure tunnels to allow remote users to connect to a network. \{IPSec\} is “a framework of open standards 
for ensuring private, secure communications over \{IP\} networks, through the use of cryptographic security services.” The 802.1x standard is used for securin
g the transfer of messages between a user and an access point. Secure Shell consists of both a client and server that use public-key cryptography to provide s
ession encryption. It provides the ability to forward arbitrary ports over an encrypted connection. Security professionals have to find the balance between of
fering users the ability to work from remote locations and ensuring that the network is protected. "

abstract={Communication network technologies have been evolving extensively in the late decades. The innovations brought in the domain increase the network capabilities and open new horizons to creating novel services. In today's heterogeneous environment, service management has become an everyday challenge to service providers. Important efforts have been deployed to innovate in the exploitation of devices in restricted area networks such as the Home Area Network (HAN). In this paper, we propose a framework for self-configuration of devices within the HAN. We propose a self-configuration architecture based on the IBM MAPE-K autonomic control loop. We make use of the Broadband forum CPE WAN Management Protocol (CWMP), also known as TR-069, in the implementation of our architecture to support the applicability. A video sharing and streaming scenario is implemented and used to evaluate our framework.},

abstract={IPTV services are gaining widespread use, requiring service providers to have effective methods for remotely configuring and managing IPTV set-top boxes (STBs). Solutions for such remote management are becoming standards-based. This article examines published specifications and ongoing activities on IPTV STB remote management in four standards organizations: the Broadband Forum, the Digital Video Broadcasting Project, the Open IPTV Forum, and the Alliance for Telecommunication Industry Solutions IPTV Interoperability Forum. The authors compare the protocol and data model definitions, investigate interoperability test events, and comment on possible future directions for standardization.},

abstract = "Due to the rapid growth in popularity of Wireless Local Area
	Network (WLAN), wireless security has become one of many important
	research issues. For the \{WLAN\} security, the \{IEEE\} 802.1X
	standard provides an authentication framework that is based on the
	Extensible Authentication Protocols (EAP). In the \{EAP\} framework,
there are many authentication protocols that have been proposed, in which each
	authentication protocol has some strengths and weaknesses,
respectively. Most \{EAP\} authentication protocols lack two features: identity
	protection and withstanding man-in-the-middle attacks. In this paper,
we first propose a novel symmetric-key based certificate distribution scheme
	based on Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) cards in a
	cellular network. The symmetric-key based certificate distribution
	scheme allows mobile subscribers to obtain temporary certificates from
	the corresponding cellular network. Combining the proposed certificate
	distribution scheme with the EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security)
	protocol, we present a new \{EAP\} authentication protocol called
	USIM-based \{EAP\} authentication protocol. The new \{EAP\}
authentication protocol combining with \{USIM\} cards is an extension of the
	EAP-TLS protocol and also follows the \{EAP\} framework in the \{IEEE\}
802.1X standard. Compared to other \{EAP\} authentication protocols, the
	proposed protocol provides mutual authentication, strong identity
	protection and roaming capability between the cellular network and the
	\{WLAN\} networks. "
