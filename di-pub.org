[what was the problem, what was done, and what are the results. ]
% Do not include charts or tables in the abstract.

Today, home networks have become more complex and home owner 
does not necessarily want to administer all aspects of it.
Configuring home network devices does not differ much from configuring enterprise devices. One needs access, credentials to login and knowledge to operate the device. If configuration is out-sourced to external parties and 
done remotely, those requirements need adjustment.
Access to the end device must be provided from outside. Login credentials must be shared to operator and trustful operator must be hired to make configuration changes.
For that,  some beforehand set provisioning and distribution of authentication keys is needed.
As there already exists an infrastructure within mobile phone subscribers, that is used in the study as a trusted base.
To benefit from mobile identification it is shown how
authentication is done using extendable authentication profile (EAP) with SIM-card
and authorization checked with RADIUS protocol.
A theory, how SIM-authentication works is presented and a simulated environment
to demonstrate that is built, tested and analyzed.
As a result it is shown, that SIM authentication's benefits are strong
authentication and existing user-base, while its disadvantages include
dependency to mobile operator. Additionally, there will remain challenges in keeping SIM's identity private and in disabling unwanted re-authentications. % [or: balancing the re-authentication]
Principle has been to reuse existing techniques when combining them to such new areas as homenet and delegated management.
 For transporting authentication claims, WPA2 enterprise has been chosen, which includes RADIUS environment.
To further avoid complexity and granularity, we
only use a simple model of management network. Getting in to management network is carried out at home network via EAP-SIM authentication and it is the key element of the thesis.

PREFACE TEMPLATE! SKIP.

This document template conforms to Guide to Writing a Thesis at
Tampere University of Technology (2014) and is based on the previous
template. The main purpose is to show how the theses are formatted
using LaTeX (or \LaTeX ~ to be extra fancy) .


The thesis text is written into file \texttt{d\_tyo.tex}, whereas
\texttt{tutthesis.cls} contains the formatting instructions. Both
files include lots of comments (start with \%) that should help in
using LaTeX. TUT specific formatting is done by additional settings on
top of the original \texttt{report.cls} class file. This example needs
few additional files: TUT logo, example figure, example code, as well
as example bibliography and its formatting (\texttt{.bst}) An example
makefile is provided for those preferring command line. You are
encouraged to comment your work and to keep the length of lines
moderate, e.g. <80 characters. In Emacs, you can use \texttt{Alt-Q} to
break long lines in a paragraph and \texttt{Tab} to indent commands
(e.g. inside figure and table environments). Moreover, tex files are
well suited for versioning systems, such as Subversion or Git.  
% \url{http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf}

Acknowledgements to those who contributed to the thesis are generally
presented in the preface. It is not appropriate to criticize anyone in
the preface, even though the preface will not affect your grade. The
preface must fit on one page. Add the date, after which you have not
made any revisions to the text, at the end of the preface.

# - Explain structure of the thesis
# Makupaloja tulevasta ja rakenne
# Home 

Managing computer and network devices can be hard.  Modern homes have
become similar to small offices regarding the equipment present there.
Earlier, it was sufficient to make just minimal settings at home to a
modem (cable, phone or radio) and connect it to the home computer to
get a fully working home network with internet connectivity.  Now, home
network has expanded with countless devices available. 
Entertainment centers (AV-amplifiers, media players, game consoles),
manageable network devices (switches/routers), and mobile phones
represent new devices and network segments beside computers and
printers. Sensors and controller devices from the Internet of Things
domain bring their own increment to the device count at home.
# Configuration of the devices 
# connecting is not difficult, managing is 
Connecting these devices to the net remains trivial, but managing the
network afterwards has become challenging and complex.

# 1. issue of separate areas 
There might be separate areas in homes that have different needs regarding
connectivity, resources, and access. Not only that, but devices in
separate segments might not belong to the home owner anymore, hence needing
# 2.Home network can be divided to multiple segments that each have
their own administrative parties. For example, an electricity company may
have a sensor and controller network, which physically uses the home network, but
is logically separated from the other parts of the home network. It is therefore
important to keep track of who is allowed to access which part of the
home network. 


#  even at home.
# 3. Something about knowledge, who knows how to configure.
The configuration choices in networking devices take some
amount of expertise that is not necessarily present at every
home. There could exist a market for an external consultant service, which would
remotely manage the home network.
# 4. authentication part, who is authorized, how it is done today, why
# that is problem? 
# 5. exporting managing, i.e., delegated configuration
# physical presence
Remote management eliminates the consultant's 
physical precence at home and so reduces external actors' costs, but adds many questions
regarding security, not only to overcome firewalls, NATs, and disconnections.
Persons who are allowed to make configuration changes are today
often authenticated only by a simple password and physical precence at home.
# , and if physical precence would be away 
#  What then, when the person is not
# physically present, but tries to connect remotely?
If external help was present, the home owner would need more 
control allowing only authorized operators in, because the 
# physical presence 
protection used earlier would be missing.

# Secondly, 
# Lastly,
Finally, it is challenging to find a common, 
trusted entity, upon which every actor could base their trust.
# Common trust
Mutual trust
 is needed to join the formerly unknown parties together
safely. 
# 
# Mieti olisko joku muu sana kuin summarized,. in a nutshell käy
Summarized, the problems are the delegated network management, remote
provisioning, and trust finding. At its roots, this is an authentication
and authorization problem.

# 1. delegation part with a)management, b) provisioning  prob.
# 2. AA prob.
# Can also be used for local authentication; Full Auth vs re-auth
# (offline) vs. ?  When local authentication has been solved, describe the
# management interface.

# count of devices part: move up to (2) , but owner part to delegation
# (3)


# same thing, other words:
#  In the future, home networks will become more and more complex for
# common man to manage. Reasons for that are increasing number of
# devices, topology change of network from bus or star to mesh, needs
# for separate networks inside home, and power saving ( demands). 
#
# To manage the home network one may not always need to change settings after
# the initial setting (bootstrap), but there will come times when
# changes are inevident and probability of making errors rises. Even,
# when home network topology stays stable, i.e. no device is added,
# removed or changed, configuration changes are highly probable.
#
# [Those are authenticity and and authorization: how to identify remote
# modifier and what operations are allowed for them.]

# ## management and background from the cloud
# 20150624: start with inner bootstrap, not the cloud.

# CLOUD away or if let here, then explain the background.
# Here mentioned delegation of management. This paper should
# concentrate on management part, but if delegated management would be
# noticed, then it need some more detailed background.


One model to solve these problems is to separate the management and
control functions from the connectivity and routing
issues. Silverajan et al.\cite{silverajan2015collaborative} proposes
a model where the management is achieved through a service in a cloud.
The cloud service is of type Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) which is suited
well for mobile app usage. The
configuration model of devices in a home is mirrored to the cloud as a
resource graph ( Figure x.1 TBD). Changes can be planned ahead in the cloud
and committed (Pushed) later to the home  using configuration 
tools CoAP and RESTCONF running over CoAP (Constrained Application
Protocol)
# tool Restconf
 via a local controller point located at home.
# (Figure[[fig:localcontroller]]).
CoAP is suitable for IoT devices having constrained resources.

The managers operate in the cloud with the configuration data and the
cloud verifies those managers,
# The cloud has already verified the operators in the cloud
but the question that remains, is how to connect the cloud service to the home network
through the local controller securely. The local controller at home
would approve the changes and a smartphone is assumed to function in
local controller role. It will operate as a bridge between the cloud and the home network.
See Figure[[fig:localcontroller]] for the design of this architecture.

# That delegation is planned to be provided from outside the home as a
# service running in internet, and it is often referenced as a cloud
# service.  
The delegated service provider therefore does not need to have a direct data
access to the home but only to the cloud based service in order to be able to
manage the home network devices.
Consultant service is not the only possible delegation for home network.
# toisen kerran jo..
# phys precence moved to earlier part


# Cloud here means external software running in internet.

# Why network needs management?
# - central vs. console login (later?)
# What security problems there are
#  - key distribution
#  - weakness of cred.based 
#  + computer-human interaction, usability

# complexity - already said

# Also there will be devices like power measuring and lighting
# controlling working on Internet of Things domains and they are


# Security below
# cloud or device?
# The ideas for interoperatibility between 3GPP- and IP-networks are influenced
# from \cite{hav-doc}.

One of the security issues is the authentication and authorization 
from the cloud to the home net.
To secure the connection from the cloud service (controller)
to the home network, there needs to be a mutual trust between the end
points, and the research problem here is how to enable the trust between the
controller and the home network as the controller lies at the edge of the
home network.


Any encryption between devices needs trusted key exchange beforehand,
and finding and establishing trust is needed for that.  That is called
the key distribution problem. Public and privat keys solve the key exchange part, but
only partially, because the trust still must be found somewhere.
The above mentioned cloud solution for delegated home network
management currently has preliminary authentication and access model
using pre-defined credentials and SSH-connection from the local
controller device to configuration
targets\cite[Chap.4]{silverajan2015collaborative}.
# while the communication between the cloud and the local controller
# happens with REST
# % present solution for 
# % preset trusted and secured key distribution,
# %
That does not yet handle the bootstrap of the infrastructure, 
i.e., the first trust is taken as given. 

The smartphone with its Subscriber Identity Module (later SIM) and an
existing key infrastructure to the mobile
network operator (MNO) would later eliminate the requirement for an
additional credential distribution. That issue is studied in this
thesis.  Although the smartphone provides alternative authentication
method with its SIM key, usual methods to authenticate still are plain
username-password combinations.  Those security issues must be solved
before delegation in the cloud can happen.
#  Anchoring must be set somewhere, 
# is When Trust can be anchored to an entity 
 

# although the correct term were SIM card with application and keys on
# older smart cards and USIM with SIM-application running inside USIM
# card on newer smart cards.

The trust can be derived from the facts that already are known.  The
place where a trust is no longe derived or built upon any other fact
but is assumed to be present is called a trust anchor.  
[OR: /A trust anchor is the fact, state or place,
where derivation is done no more, but accepted per se./ ]
Combining existing techniques, this thesis presents one possible way
to bind the home network's trust to the smartphone's unique, existing
secret keys inside the smart card's Subscriber Identify Module (SIM),
which then would function as a trust anchor. 
The ultimate trust can be achieved by verifying the trust chains 
until the chain reaches a trust anchor.

# To generally find
# ultimate trust it is only needed to verify trust chains until the
# chain reaches a trust anchor.


# To generally find
# ultimate trust it is only needed to verify trust chains until the

# Rationale:
# Motivation factors to this work is 




The Human aspect and usability are important, but the focus will
still be on authentication and authorization part of the home net
management with smartphone as a trust anchor.  The proposed model
should nevertheless require less effort than the currently used methods
on distributing user credentials, finding the right place for them to be
inserted, and ensuring that they are written correctly.
Besides those, problems such as limited connectivity are
studied.



# Involved technology acronyms include RADIUS, EAP, Wi-Fi,
# HRL-AUC-Gateway, OpenWRT, and WPA2.


The thesis is structured as follows: Chapter [[#cha:aaa]] explains the
authentication--authorization model.  Chapter [[#cha:management]] describes
security in current home net architecture and current practices for
configuring it.  Chapter [[#cha:design]] discusses methods to bring a
trust anchor in the home network and explains the chosen method.
# different scenarios for authorization.  
One specially crafted problem is how the scenarios presented here can be
tested without knowing the SIM card's secret keys and without real phone
operator involved.  Those experiments are described in Chapter
[[#cha:simu]].
# [Simulation of authentication between SIM-card and mobile operator
# is shown and analyzed on Chapter [[#cha:simu]].
# Security analysis is
Results are discussed on Chapter [[#cha:discussion]] and Chapter [[#cha:conclusion]] concludes the
thesis.

policies, i.e., who is granted access or what operations user is
allowed to do. They only transport this information between client
who needs them and server authorized to provide them.
# client and Authenticator server.
Often, the last 'A' which stands for accounting has been neglected
and also here only first two A's are used and later described as AA
services. Authentication (AuthN) answers how to identify users and
prove that they really are who they claim to be. Authorization (AuthZ)
answers what operations the identified users are allowed to do and
forces usage policy. The rest of the thesis uses shortened terms AuthN
and AuthZ.

On very small environments AA service is built on static backend such
as file on protected target that the object wants to access. There AuthN
is checked against a credentials file and authorization from a service
specific policy file. 
#  Examples include ...
To be more exact, identification preceding authentication is the part,
# of the access control process. Identification is part of AuthN
# and it is the process
where entity claims and presents its identity to 
access controlling system. That can involve sending username, login
name or other identifier. Authentication in turn is the part where
those facts are verified. AuthZ involves checking, which rights are 
available for authenticated entity. 
# [[access control]]
# explain TRUST


Before we introduce SIM-based authentication used throughout the
thesis, protocols 802.1X, WPA2, EAP and RADIUS are described in the
following Sections. [sections?]. Last, we expand the term trust.

** 802.1X

802.1X\cite{8021X} is an IEEE standard protocol for port based access
control. Ports are physical layer ports, not to be mixed to Layer-4 ports such as TCP/UDP ports.
# explain physical vs. virtual port and source
# Port means logical port instead of physical port can be .
 Network access through a specific physical port is
restricted (controlled) from a client (called Supplicant) before
the client has successfully performed an AA. A 802.1X device, where
the ports are located, is called the Authenticator. Third party in 802.1X is an
Authentication server.

# It also can have internal Authentication server, which is used for
# groups having pre-shared key as a proof of trust
# (PSK-mode). [pre-shared key]

# include it inside  and it can function as RADIUS client to
# consult RADIUS-server for AuthN. 
It is easy to mix here terms /Authenticator/ and /Authentication
server/, but their roles are different: Authenticator works as a
gate-keeper to ports between supplicant and network, while
Authentication server handles AA processes.
At home, Authenticator usually lies inside the access point, but 
on large enterprise networks, Authenticator can be a centralized unit 
and multiple access points function only as radio stations.



** RADIUS 
<<sec:radius>>
# Here RADIUS-server takes a role of an Authentication server.
RADIUS is the most popular provider for 
AAA-services\cite[p.75]{radius-popular}.  It was used first with remote terminal
and dial-up modem users, hence the name Remote Authentication Dial-In
User Service. Later it was used as centralized AAA for networking
devices such as switches and routers.

# In addition to RADIUS, there  exists similar protocol called Diameter


RADIUS protocol is a stateless, request-response type client-server
protocol. 
# explain, what is ACCESS here.. 
# not needed, changed word <2015-08-09 su>
There are four types of RADIUS messages defined in RFC 2865 that are
used in AA. ACCESS-REQUEST and ACCESS-CHALLENGE cover both AuthN and
AuthZ messaging while final RADIUS message is either
ACCESS-ACCEPT or ACCESS-REJECT, based on the
result given by the RADIUS authentication server.

Today, RADIUS has some shortcomings and fixing them is not anymore
reasonable as developing has shifted to another AAA protocol called
Diameter, which is already in use in 3GPP and 4G
networks\cite{diameter}.  Nevertheless, as RADIUS is so wide-spread,
it is still used in lots of places instead of Diameter.  Currently,
the main environment of RADIUS, besides network managing, is wireless
connections (Wi-Fi) in enterprises and nationwide community
federations.


When local Wi-Fi groups in Finland such as ``SparkNet'', ``Langaton
Tampere'', or ``Wippies'' started to form in around 2005, they used
802.1X and RADIUS for AA. Those networks did still have as an
alternative AA method a captive portal technique, where user
first authenticates on WWW-page before getting an access.  802.1X and
RADIUS enabled users in those group to consult external,
central RADIUS server for authentication requests automatically,
without burden that captive portal brings.  The members of Wi-Fi
groups can use network anywhere, where the same uniform SSID (Service
Set IDentifier) was seen, i.e., roaming
# one's own network became
became possible, if one found a familiar SSID outside home area.  Later, there were agreements between different local groups
to allow roaming and so federations were born.

As seen from federated Wi-Fi groups, RADIUS servers can be chained to
form a tree. The reasons for the chaining are load balancing and high
availability, centralization of locally distant servers, and
federation of different domains. In RADIUS trees, the messages are
chained and proxied to next RADIUS server, depending on the settings
on the proxying RADIUS server.
# proxied from NAS via proxying RADIUS servers to the end point which
# makes the true decision about Authenticity and Access (A-A).


In the following chapters it is discussed how proxying servers take 
part in AA decisions. Of main interest there is, if it is possible 
# If RADIUS has been chained, it was not clear in the beginning of this
# study, is it possible
to inject or modify AuthZ information in those proxying RADIUSes in
cases, where AuthN and AuthZ are provided from different
 places\cite{rfc2607}. Secondary goal is to universally divide AA regarding 
clients domain in the federation.

** WPA2

Wireless protected access (WPA or WPA2) protects traffic in wireless,
shared media, where everyone otherwise can simple listen all the radio traffic.
# simply listen the traffic on radio waves. 
It enables both authenticated access and message
encryption between the smartphone and wireless access point (AP) by negotiating session keys
after 802.1X has opened the virtual port in AP for the Supplicant.

WPA (version 1)  was an early subset of then upcoming 802.11i standard,
while WPA2 is the full implementation, also noted as IEEE
802.11i-2004, and the term WPA2 is used throughout the thesis.
# WPA2 consist of client (WPA2-supplicant), Authenticator, and Authentication Server.
Client software for 802.11i is called a WPA2-Supplicant and it is used
in wireless clients to communicate with the Authenticator. 
# The rest of the work will not make a difference between WPA and WPA2
# versions, but simply denotes them as ``WPA''.

WPA2 has two modes of protection: one for groups with common, pre-shared
key (WPA2-PSK, also known as WPA2-Personal) and one for individuals
(WPA2-RADIUS, also known as  WPA2-Enterprise).  With WPA2-RADIUS, revoking
individual access is easier, but client setup slightly more
complicated than on WPA2-PSK, as seen on Table[[psk-enterprise]].

** EAP
# Mechanism to extend 802.1X protocol authentication methods is achieved
# with EAP framework \cite{rfc5247} (Extensible Authentication
# Protocol). Instead of bringing new AuthN methods into 802.1X, modular
# protocol EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) was developed and
# support for it added once into 802.1X.  There exists sub-types of EAP
# for example for methods using hashed passwords, certificates,
# server-side certificate protected password, or SIM/AKA using smart
# phone's SIM card.

Instead of bringing new AuthN methods into 802.1X, it was 
extended with a modular framework called 
 EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol)\cite{rfc5247}. 
Researchers justify using EAP, as it
provides flexibility independent from underlying technology, whether
wireless or wired,  and integration with AAA infrastructures, although
it adds some amount of time for authentication.\cite{pereniguez10}.
# re-auth method to solve "amount of time" problem
Different authentication methods, for example hashed passwords, TLS
 certificates, or SIM/AKA using smartphone's SIM card,  can
be used with EAP.
This work uses EAP-SIM authentication method.


EAP describes only the messaging form, so EAP messages needs to
be encapsulated inside another protocol.  In Wi-Fi, between a smartphone
and an AP, EAP is encapsulated into 802.1X protocol (as EAPOL) or
into protected EAP(PEAP)\cite{peap} before sending
into air. In wired net those EAP messages are translated and encapsulated into RADIUS.

The encapsulation is described in Figure[[fig:eap-layers]] where it
can be seen, that EAP messaging happens logically between the EAP peer
and the
Authentication server. On a lower transport layer there is an EAP
Authenticator in between them, which transfers EAPOL messaging into
RADIUS message.

** SIM-based authentication
<<sec:sim-based-auth>>
# explain MNO 
SIM associates a physical card used in smartphones to
a subscriber of the Mobile Network Operator (MNO).
SIM here means the secret keys and the application in mobile phone's
SIM or USIM inside UICC(Universal Integrated Circuit Card).
The secret keys are hardware protected and only usable to applications
in SIM card.
The SIM's storage also includes a unique serial number ICCID 
(Integrated Circuit Card Identifier) which identifies SIM globally
#  A full ICCID is 19 or 20 
# +358 50 3075923
 and a unique IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity). IMSI is
# IMSI is 14 or 15 digit long number and presented as 
a composition of digits belonging to Mobile Country Code(MCC, 2
digits), Mobile Network Code(MNC,2-3 digits) and Mobile Subscriber
Identification Number(MSIN, 10 digits at most).
More familiar, it is the user's full international phone number.
[ More detailed SIM architecture? Java Card, CPU,?]


SIM card usage can be controlled by two passwords: PIN and PUK.  PUK
is used as a remedy, if PIN has been inserted wrong too many times.
If the card has other applications, for example mobile electrical
signature application Mobiilivarmenne, they may have different keys
and codes.


MNO distributes SIM card and provides mobile network connectivity to
its customer.  The secret keys are used for authenticating the IMSI
to MNO and that enables MNOs to identify their customer in the network
and charge them correspondingly. It is assumed, that SIM card represent
its owner but in reality nothing prevents an identity thief to steal
someone's SIM card. Although 4-digit PIN tries to prevent the usage of 
stolen SIM, that is considered as a weak safe\cite[p.31]{aaa-nakhjiri2005}.


AA services need to trust some entity endpoint and in case of MNO and
SIM, they already mutually trust each other, and SIM can be used 
to open access to mobile networks.
# From that point, a trust can be chained all the way to the access decision point. 
# The trust entity endpoint is called a trust anchor.
# MNO and SIM trust mutually each other.
Separate access credentials for Wi-Fi access was still needed
and that was the reason of developing EAP-SIM and later the
derivatives EAP-AKA and EAP-AKA'.  The goal was to combine in a secure
way existing keys used in  GSM (Global system for Mobile communication)
Wi-Fi access. Existing general purpose EAP-methods in 2004 were not
compatible with GSM protocols for this purpose.\cite[p.93]{hav-doc}
# [More security stuff, operator-specific parts in AKA', explained here
# if not already compared earlier. Just clarify the main points,
# compare weaknesses with strengths]
# SIM can be used via EAP-types EAP-SIM \cite{rfc4186},
# EAP-AKA \cite{rfc4187} or EAP-AKA'(AKA-PRIME) \cite{rfc5448}.  215
# insert-char 2022 •
# tai
# C-x 8 ENTER  2022
# •
# [ Write out this list]
The result of development was that today SIM can be used via EAP-types EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA, or
EAP-AKA'(AKA-PRIME).

EAP-SIM is the original type created for GSM networks and defined 
in RFC4186\cite{rfc4186}.
It is a challenge-response method and similar to AuthN used in GSM, 
but it adds mutual AuthN, i.e., also the network is authenticated.
# before smartphone sends its first identification message.
Network authentication is achieved, if 
the network is able to correctly respond to a client sent nonce,
#  when client sends a nonce, 
which by definition is a value used only once. The nonce can
be thought as  client's challenge to network.
# , and network must response to that nonce in
# in a correct form.
# OR in a correct form in the network's signature response. 

The client in  turn is authenticated, when the Authentication server
generates a challenge with an aid of a triplet from the MNO and the
client responses to it correctly.
# as a authentication backend
# generates challenge using triplet (IMSI, Ki, OPc).
That procedure is later described in more detail.
# received from MNO to authenticate SIM
# GSM authentication protocol is used, but additionally client
# adds a nonce, which must be received back from network in right form 
# to prove, that network is authenticated also.
# Network is authenticated if AP eventually has returned 
# to the SIM user the nonce in correct form.
# EAP-SIM was used in test cases here.
# - EAP-SIM :: EAP for GSM Subscriber Identity. RFC4186. GSM AuthN
#              protocol, network AuthN verified, if AP knows right

# based on right triplets. [Does not check AuthN Request itself??]

Beginning from 3GPP networks, new types EAP-AKA and AKA' can be used.
EAP-AKA is defined in RFC4187\cite{rfc4187} and 
uses 3GPP's AKA (Authentication and Key Agreement) protocol.
It differs from EAP-SIM by using additional parameters such as
sequence numbering from MNO to protect replay attacks. 
Additionally, digests use SHA-256 function instead of SHA-1.\cite{rfc5448}.
Otherwise the protocol messaging is same as in  EAP-SIM, only algorithms differ.
# , and it increments after each invocation. AMF is used for authentication. 
# - EAP-AKA :: EAP for UMTS Authentication and Key Agreement
#              RFC4187. 3GPP-AKA protocol, mutual AuthN and network's
#              AuthN verified after receiving
#             EAP-request/AKA-Challenge. Values SQN and AMF from SIM
#             used for that. Incrementing SQN values eliminates replay
#             attacks.  This is not tested here.
Last, there exists EAP-AKA' that enhances AKA by including Service Set
Identifier (SSID) 
in the key derivation function, which limits the possibility of using possibly
compromised network's nodes and keys. 


  Using EAP-SIM means using the secret key inside SIM card with A3/A8
algorithms to generate valid responses for the challenges coming from 
MNO and to derive session keys.  The algorithms used (A3/A8) and their
possible implementations (COMP128, COMP128v2, COMPv3) are not of
interest in this work beside the point that they are MNO specific or known reference algorithms.


EAP-SIM derivatives provide strong AuthN which means here two-factor
AuthN. A one factor  is something you own (physical SIM) while  
another
is  something you know (SIM card's PIN). Biometric factor, i.e., what you are,
is not used here, but that would be a third different possible factor.
# No need to explain strong authN, i.e., what you own, what you know,
# what you are. well known fact?
# Comparing these to
Software based certificates, while stronger than regular passwords,
on the other hand do not possess the properties /non-copiable/ or
/unique/, so they can only be considered as strong passwords and 
do not full-fill the requirements for two-factor AuthN.  If we nonetheless
were using software certificates with a method such as EAP-TLS, then the
certificates (for CA and client) and the private key should still be
provisioned first, which would defeat what we want to achieve in
easy user experience.


Disadvantages with SIM are dependency on mobile operator and internet
connection, although disconnectivity issues are later addressed
partly in Section [[sec:disconnections]].
Using smartphone may cost money, either to client or to service
provider, but costs could be lower than using SMS, because 
the network  used is IP network instead of cellular phone network.

# Using EAP-SIM is in many parts simpler to mobile client.  
In many parts, SIM variants in EAP are simpler than other EAP
variants to mobile client.  Table[[table-peapsim]] compares the setup of Wi-Fi
in clients of one existing organization to EAP-SIM. It
is noteworthy, that plain EAP-SIM will not support identity hiding and
that will be later discussed further. If we added PEAP
also to EAP-SIM (in last column of Table[[table-peapsim]]), comparison would be more fair.
# . [combine this to identity privacy text].  
As can be seen from the table, leaving certificates out from the environment
makes client setup easier with the price of revealing smartphone user's
identity.

#+RESULTS:
[[file:eap-sim-simple.png]]





# EAP-SIM was invented to eliminate separate Wi-Fi credentials and
# instead combine existing GSM-keys in secure way for Wi-Fi access.
# f240503075923



Important parameters for this work are IMSI, NONCE, and triplet values
corresponding IMSI (RAND, SRES, Kc).
Sequence diagram of full EAP-SIM authentication between Supplicant (here
smartphone) and Authenticator (in AP) is shown in
Figure[[fig:eap-sim-radius]]. 
# Not shown are the Authentication server, but 
#   Figure [[fig:eap-sim-radius]] describes the EAP-SIM authentication
# sequence.  
There we can see that IMSI is used in message 2. IMSI is the
identity, which Authentication server would next try to challenge and
for which the AuthZ would be checked.





# From the Figure[[fig:eap-sim-radius]] we can see, that IMSI, which is client's identity, is

# client can use pseudonym to
# hide its identity.

All EAP-SIM derivatives provide mutual authentication.
#  using a NONCE value.
# in message 4, that would not be possible.
An operator is authenticated, when the client challenges it by sending
a NONCE value during the start of the negotiation phase in the message
4 in Figure[[fig:eap-sim-radius]). The client later checks in the process
7, whether RAND values from the operator were digested with the
correct NONCE.

After session has been set, IMSI may be left out and a temporal IMSI
(TMSI) can be used instead to hide client's identity, for example in
fast re-authentication case to reduce the risk of exposing the client's
IMSI unnecessarily. Unfortunately, at that point, IMSI has already
been exposed once in plain text, namely in message 2.
It must be noted, that TMSI used here differs from TMSI used in 3GPP
networks. Those context must not be mixed, otherwise the security that
they bring may reduce, i.e. one must not use the TMSI received from
3GPP as TMSI in EAP-SIM.

TMSI is composed of pseudonym and realm part and can be a
string. So, one can send 
=my-string-which-can-change@…operator.domain= instead of 
IMSI number (or =IMSI@...…operator.domain=) as an identity.

# 
# ** Security considerations I (for all methods, within their
# sections)
** Trust

# Trust is the base.
Secure communication has many layers and on its base lies trust. 
# Without trust, any added encryption or secrecy loses its value. 
# there is little help with any added encryption or secrecy. 
# Setting trust is usually not an easy task, but only after
Only after completing trust setting phase it is meaningful to complete
the other security layers. For example, secret keys enable encrypted
communication, but they need to be delivered first through an trusted
channel. Same applies to public key infrastructure solution, when
exchanging public parts of keys and so it can be seen that trust
really is the first layer to be fixed.

# [ Trusted communication works, but need FIRST to nail trust
#   somewhere.  Distribution of secret keys (ie passwords or
#  certificates) without trust not possible.]


Even without trust, some form of secure asymmetric key-exchange is achievable
with Diffie-Hellman key-exchange\cite{diffie1976new}. Unfortunately, it is vulnerable
to Man-in-the-middle(MitM) attacks, where protocol does not notice, 
if messaging goes through third party, which impersonates itself to 
both ends as being the corresponding messaging partner. MitM can
read and decrypt encrypted messages and forward possibly changed message with
correct looking signature.
#  [MiTM discussed on IMSI-catching section]
# [explain or cite], but
# without trust,
# communicating devices are 
With trust set between two devices, i.e.,  if they can securely
authenticate each other, secret communication is possible. 
Secure network configuration and credential exchange is then possible.

# ]



Now, how this trust could be used to include other components under
same trust circle in the home network? As mentioned earlier, the SIM
and MNO trust each other hence mutual authentication between them is
possible and that is later shown to be an important factor.  Also the
key distribution problem mentioned in Chapter[[cha:intro]] is solved
already at SIM-card distribution phase.  As AuthN-AuthZ at home
proceeds through the Authenticator, maybe the Authenticator can
deliver this information further and use it as a derivation function
to extend trust.

** Home network architecture and IETF

# [home network also in Chapter [[#cha:management]] ]

Home network is a computer network located at person's home. It consists
of devices and their connections, either wired or wireless.

This thesis avoids using term /homenet/ when meaning network at home,
because  it is  reserved to 
# denotes home network as homenet, although the name 'homenet'
# is reserved  to
Internet Engineering Task Force Working Group's (IETF
WG) homenet. IETF is responsible for the most Internet technology standards and 
WG homenet was started in year 2011.
Current drive in homenet management is towards IPv6 environment
 as it allows future  addressing and routing needs. 
Homenet has five tasks to solve at home networks: service discovery, network security, 
prefix configuration for routers, routing management and name
resolution.\cite{homenet-charter}.
As old technology cannot be forgotten, home networks will be heterogeneous having both
old and new technology, and their interoperatibility is important in
planning future home networks. 
Segmenting home in multiple subnets will also belong
to homenets and will include areas for home members, guests,
and management. It will also not be so uncommon to have a cheap second
network operator for backup purposes at home, so issues about
multihoming are added to homenet.
Lastly, end-to-end access, is in their
agenda. End-to-end access, i.e., restriction-free access was the key
element for the Internet's success and it enabled many new
applications in the past, but has then had difficulties because of
firewalls and NATs.
# 5 tasks:
# o service discovery, 
# o network security
# o prefix configuration for routers
# o managing routing
# o name resolution


# Home Network consists of devices and their interconnects in home. There
# belongs also routing devices that segment network to diverse
# domains.

Securing home network and its router's configuration can be done for
example first limiting access to their administrative ports
with static or dynamic access control lists (ACL) in
routers. To get through administrative ports, i.e., to login and make
configuration changes, there exists either AAA or local authentication.
# ACLs in turn are defined  are secured from change by AAA. 
Authorized agents can then make changes, either direct in the device or through some
management protocol such as SNMP or NETCONF[source needed?].  SNMP has been in
use for over 30 years and is well supported in routers. Yet there are
multiple version for this protocol. While earlier versions (v1, v2)
did not provide any encryption of messages, version 3 knows for example
about public keys and is secure enough when used correctly.
# NETCONF is...

# two main class
#  - in premises (console-access either local or remote)
# - protocol-based (SNMP, NETCONF, etc.)

Customer Premises Equipments (CPE) such as ADSL broadband routers or
set-top boxes, connect customer's network to operator's network.
Management of CPEs on the border of home network and operator has 
existing protocols. For example, TR-069 standard\cite{iptvtr069} for CPEs
# lähde ehkä ei ihan kerro TR-069 perusasioita..
has been used to implement self-configuration archi\-tecture in
home networks\cite{tr069rachidi2011}.
# [source for tr-069 ]
# lähde?
# or mobile phone update?
# Not in home networks: 
# On these days research is done with Light-weight Machine to Machine
# (LWM2M) processes. 
# [What are the things homenet working group proposes?]


# about border 
RFC7368 about IPv6 Home Networking Architecture Principles from
Arkko\cite{rfc7368} defines the borders of the home network and states that
internal borders in home network should possibly be automatically
discovered. Limiting those borders to specific
interface type would make it difficult to connect different realms locally.
The same document continues stating
that while home network should self-configure and self-organize itself as
far as possible, self-configuring unintended devices should be
avoided and let home network user decide whether device becomes trusted.
So, these statements reveal us that home network environment still needs
external configuration even with the proposed automation aids.


# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
#  "It is important that self-configuration with 'unintended' devices
# is avoided.  There should be a way for a user to administratively
# assert in a simple way whether or not a device belongs to a homenet."
# [..]  An approach is needed that allows to establish trust inside a
# homenet according to a policy set by the user of the homenet.
# #+END_QUOTE


# C-c C-x [,  
# cite{draft-behringer-bootstrap},
# There are proposed techniques for that for example in Internet-draft
# draft-behringer-bootstrap \cite{draft-behringer-bootstrap} where 
# Authentication (may) need some # bootstrapping of trust for start.

Homenet WG proposes the use of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) at 
home. The public key cryptography is processor intensive and its
asymmetric keys are usually used just in the beginning of
communication. There they can be used to securely negotiate symmetric
keys which allow faster cryptography processing.
# [source not needed. is well known fact]

To use PKI, bootstrapping protocols are first needed for trust
anchoring and AuthN.  Despite the etymology of name bootstrapping,
``Lift oneself by his own bootstraps'', bootstrapping usually needs
some input from outside.
For that, draft from Behringer\cite{draft-behringer-bootstrap} proposes,
that one device is first chosen as a trust anchor and trust is
built upon that anchor. This anchored device then becomes home network's
Certificate Authority (CA) service. In the end, the rest of the home network 
devices need to apply for certificates from that CA to get under same
trust circle.
# Regarding
Key creation, key exchange and their usage is explained in similar
draft from Pritikin[[cite:draft-pritikin-bootstrap][I-D.pritikin]]. There is also discussion about using
manufacturer provided device certificates as trust anchor.  

# Rest of gba:

# *** Ticket based, separate authentication and authorization

This model could also be expanded to a full ticket enabled
Kerberos style network, where time-limited tickets (tokens) for
both authentication and authorization exist for different services. Trusted
Third Party authentication center would be setup with the help of MNO.
# One could also model home network to use separate authentication 
# and authorization service in style of Kerberos. That would help
# on limiting access based on time, role, service and user to name few.
# - Needham-Schröder background, Kerberos, GBA def.
# [explain similarities and basic flow on kerberos.]
# K kerberos bears similarities: 
# Trust there is bound to trusted third party service, 
# AuthN is mutual, 
One service would then authenticate an entity, here smartphone, and
give it a time-limited ticket as a proof that the entity has been authenticated.
# With this [...] (Ticket-Granting-Ticket) together with TGS session key.
When the entity wants to connect to the service, it asks from the central 
server again for ticket, but this time for the service by presenting
the authentication ticket. In return it receives a service ticket which
it can present to the wanted service. 
If EAP-SIM was applied in such environment, it would be used only once, namely in
the bootstrapping phase to setup the CA trust anchor.

Home Network configuration itself is mostly excluded from this work.
For example, 
# moved here from 4.3 (chosen design section)
it is desirable, that changes in home network are done only through
local controller, not at local device because of
synchronization issues, even 
# but that will rise question for further studies
if synchronizing algorithms such as Trickle\cite{rfc6206} were used in
home network for configuration propagation. As another example,
configuration also includes
power level settings of devices to save electricity based on usage
profile. For example at nights or when there is nobody home, some
devices do not need to be working at their maximum capacity. 

Instead, we study interfaces of AA.  Main points here are an existing
infrastructure (phones, internet access, Wi-Fi access points),  a strong
authentication (two-factor), and authentication methods
(EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA, EAP-AKA').

# from console to central management
** Centralization trends in management

Traditionally, management of network devices has been done
individually using each device's console or web-access.  As the number of
devices has increased, it would have been reasonable to rationalize
the process by utilizing a central management, not least to prevent human
errors for repetitive tasks.  Yet, at home, network devices often are
too heterogeneous, bought at different times from different vendors
and so incompatible with each other to fully benefit from
centralization. 

To help moving the management to a more centralized
model, the home network will see smartphone as a central managing local
controller.
# cloud service of type Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) is used here for
# configurations. The smartphone can be thought as an extension of the
# BaaS and it will have an application which configureEAPs home network
# devices.  The smartphone is called a local controller and it is the
# central management device for the home network.
Usually, home users already have a phone, which can be considered 
`smart'. Most smartphones have Wi-Fi capabilities and writing programs
for them is possible even with only little knowledge.
#  so they well suited as being the local controller.
# Maybe adding "between cloud and home network."
#
# Here we want to set the smartphone as management point between cloud and home network.
When we choose a smartphone to be the management point, the other benefits are
numerous:  a management software can be delivered and
updated from cloud to diverse smartphone types, existing user
base having smartphones is orders of magnitude more than in any single
organization, and as the most important fact, the trust anchor can be set to the smartphone.

# 1.Updating the running software has become an import fact in computer
# security, since non-patched software, which still there has been running 
# 2.
The users are already located centrally in operators' user databases
in Home Location Registry Authentication Center (HLR-AuC).  To be able
to achieve the management paradigm change to a central configured one,
we still need to bridge home network to that model with a trusted local controller
and resolve the work-flow of change management.

* Design of home network trust anchor and separation of change management
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: cha:design
:END: 


# IDEA: 
#  - Changing home network management style from console-style
#   management to app-style management) 


# This chapter describes, how the change management can flow after the
#  after the
# home network has received a trust anchor in the smartphone.  

This chapter describes, how the smartphone becomes a trust anchor for
the home network and how the change management can flow after that.
On its simplest, the smartphone connects with a Wi-Fi link to an
AP in the home network and authenticates with SIM-card.
# AP functions here as an Authenticator. 
The resulting authorized connection brings a trust relationship
between the smartphone (a local controller)
and the home network (managed devices) so that the 
# configuration changes
management can happen. 
#  as long as the smartphone is present. 
In essence, the precence of the smartphone at home
opens the gate for the management, though it needs a little
interaction on behalf the user.



Before fully explaining our chosen method, we introduce some 
# real number, instead of some?
alternative
approaches for a trust anchor. The trust anchor is part of bootstrapping,
# need to explain bootstrapping more?
which is needed because although the smartphone and MNO
already trust each other, the trust between the smartphone and AP, and
thus the management network at home, is non-existing in the
beginning.
# kuva? 





# Trusted connection is needed between existing network and local
# controller, i.e., home network and local controller need to trust each other.

# The smartphone will approve changes for home network and is part of
# bootstrapping new infrastructure. 


# If an authentication is done using two
# different methods out of three possible, then it is said to be a
# strong. [CITE?]  SIM card authentication is strong and belongs to same
# category as (intelligent) USB-dongle, RSA-ID or Secure-ID hardware
# devices. They all have properties ``what you own'' and ``what you

# [during authentication].

# there is physical SIM (what you own) and secret PIN (what you know) to
# use the secret inside the SIM.

** Alternative methods for introducing trust anchor into the home network

# In bootstrapped environment change management can happen.



 Trust information, may it then be a secret or some
other evidence, can be delivered to a trust device via physical
transport channel separate from the actual communicating channel.
Traditional way to do that is with a password inside a sealed
envelope or a one-time password list that for example online banks 
use today. The secret can also be sent as an SMS.

Trust can also be requested with the help of device's
unique properties. Recently there have appeared  devices on the market that
have vendor certificates inside them[cite], which brings public key
infrastructure as one possible alternative to learn trusted identity. 
The device proves its identity by presenting a certificate, which has
been issued by a trusted vendor.  Private keys are inside the device's
trusted hardware store. Vendor-trust is needed for checking the issued certificates
and so the trust verification is merely transferred from individual
devices to trust verification of the vendor.  Root CAs are trust anchors
also and can in the same way be read from the device's read-only store.
CPE could use vendor issued certificate for AuthN of some earlier
unknown device.  If keys are stored in SIM as they here are, an
external operator support is needed.

# *** Other SIM methods 
 # mobiilivarmenne
Other techniques  to use SIM's unique properties besides EAP-SIM
are for example Bluetooth SIM Access Profile(Bluetooth  SAP), 
direct connection through PC/SC (Personal\-Computer/Smart\- Card),
CallerID service from phone network, or
Mobile signing service.
#  such as ``Mobiilivarmenne'' in Finland.

# Finnish certificate based mobile app running in the SIM card
# (brand name "Mobiilivarmenne") providing

# (Using SIM as source of authentication can mean EAP-SIM based AuthN)

# *** Bluetooth access
Bluetooth SIM and PC/SC would need patching of smartphone's software
to work.  On the other hand, the smartphone would any way need to
download  a controlling application
# from the cloud 
in the beginning for advanced use, so these techniques could be
studied further in another work.

Caller ID as an authentication method uses cellular network's controlling
channels. When a phone makes a call, the receiving end gets 
to know callers phone number (IMSI) before it answers the call.
That information is called Caller ID and it has been in use
successfully for some door locking implementations. 
It does not cost anything for caller or responder,
because after receiving the CallerID  information, responder can hang
up upcoming call and no call expenses are created.
 It can also be made safe at least in Finland
by limiting which tele operators are allowed to connect.

# *** fed services. VERY draft
SIM card can also man electronic signatures.
European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) defined a
standard for mobile signature services (MSS) in ETSI TS 102 204.
MNOs in Finland have implemented this as a 
service called ``Mobiilivarmenne``. 
For example, MNO Sonera's brand for  it is ``Sonera ID'' while MNO Elisa calls it
``Elisa Mobiilivarmenne''.
# No references (Open) available 
#
# There was one pilot program between MNO (Elisa) and organization
# (CSC) in Finland in 2015. Smartphone was used to AA.  MNO provided
# organization both AuthN and some attributes such as person's name
# and based on that AuthZ was achieved.

When AuthN and AuthZ comes from outside, one possibility is to use a
federated Mobile AuthN Service, which then is connected to  MSSP(Mobile
Signature Service Provider) with ETSI-204. Benefits for ETSI-204
federation are similar to those with federation of WiFi groups
mentioned in Section [[sec:radius]] -- no home device must implement it at home,
but also beneficial for  MNO as it sees the service as just one
client.  Without the federation, the mobile AuthN services would need to be
multiplied with number of the separate home networks  needing authentication service.

Project Moonshot, if worked and used together with MSSP, may offer
SIM-based SSH-access to Authenticator. Modifications are then needed

tunneling, for example as an inner protocol of EAP-TTLS.\cite{moonshot}
# end of fed services.

# *** Web portal with SMS passwd
# Did'nt I just explain these external providers are needed?
At this point question might rise, why these external service
providers are needed. Is it not easier and simpler to just send 
an SMS with password code to the smartphone, when access confirmation is needed?
Mobile SIM provides two-way AuthN part as discussed earlier.
Without need for strong AuthN, that model would indeed be 
simpler, but using SIM also solves initial key distribution problem.
Additionally, mutual AuthN problem would still need to be solved:
Who sent that password and where that password should be inserted?
# Why care? Explain, that fake access point and 
# captured home network session would allow dishonest admin into managing
# home network. MiTM or DoS.
# [The simpler model has been handled at section about offline and disconnectivity.]



# here attest
All this time it is assumed, that hardware does not lie. In case
the hardware has been tampered, we could not trust it and its claims.
For example, there have been attacks against SIM to reveal its private
key after SIM have been copied.  To verify, that a device has not been
tampered, a method called attestation can be used.
# [cite]! [something from attestation techniques]
# - Attestation methods for proofing,   TPM-part, to avoid tampering. [
# Check Antti's work]
A device which has attestation capability such as 
hardware certificates or Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology
can function as a trust anchor.
Such a device could be sent direct to customer with pre-configured
secrets and methods to take a place as a trust anchor. 
That leads us again to the key distribution problem.

There is also fraudulent Authenticator problem: the Authenticator may present some 
information to the Authentication server and other to the EAP-peer.
Mitigation for that is, that EAP-peer includes some 
characteristics of the Authenticator inside its EAP-message, which
then the Authentication server verifies (RFC6677)\cite{rfc6677}.


# ***  How can trust be achieved with the phone?

The phone brings trust to the home network by completing full EAP-SIM AuthN through
the local Authenticator. SIM's identity is verified by HLR AuC at the phone
operator's end. The verification leaves a trail on the local Authenticator and
opens a trust channel for a limited period of time for changes from the phone.

reading it.]

Requirement for home network can be as small as having WPA2 Enterprise capable

Additionally, managing user's SIM-card has to be registered as an admin user in home network 
configuration, i.e. IMSI must belong to the admin group.
In this implementation, no extra application is needed in smartphone
for primitive trust, but later for more serious use some application is needed.
For added functionality, for example for logging admins out, OpenWRT
based software can be used, although those functions have not yet been
implemented. Disconnection issues are explained in Section
[[sec:disconnections]].
# [picture?]

** Flow of design [TBD already above, FIX THIS section]

# Wanted: 
#  + separate MGMT net exists
#  + SIM authentication to MGMT net is proven
# - changes are authorized if they come from MGMT net
# - log-out from MGMT net
# - (spare connection, if internet link down)
# - (fast-reauth, without MNO)

# Implications are, that when someone has access to MGMT channel,
# everything is permitted. No security limiting as default 
# [Basically 2. and 3. is like traditional corporate network with firewall.]

# a. AuthN is proven
# b. AuthZ decision has challenges
# c. Change approving has three cases:
#     1. Changes are allowed, when port is open
#    2. Confirmation message from MGMT-net authorizes changes.
#       Message must belong to configuration and can be example a digested signature.
#    3. FULL: changes may come only from MGMT net.

To demonstrate how the model works, we present the case of adding a
new admin user.

Let's first suppose, for case of simplicity, that the home network has been
already configured(bootstrapped) and it is functioning properly.  The
home configuration model has been copied[inserted, etc] to the cloud.
When changes are made to the cloud model through authorized cloud
administrator users (operators), those changes are later also committed
in to the production in home network. There is no magic here, plain
configuration change, just this time externally initiated.

Now, let's think what happens, when the cloud operator (or owner of
home network) tries to modify attributes, which give access to a new actor,
such as a new operator, who would want to have access to separate
segments of home network.  First we need to have that segment separation
change approved and after that we want to allow the newcomer account
to have access to that segment and only to that. For the first part,
which is normal operation, approving would perhaps yet not be
necessary, but for the second part we need some checking unless our
trust to cloud operator is ultimate.  [FOR approval needs, discuss
this with the team.]




# to be needed for AA.
When CPE of home network is about to input configuration changes which
would change balance of authors or roles (if role-based authorization
in use), it needs to check if that is permitted.  Permission would 
need to be asked from trusted point, here mobile SIM but instead of
that the CPE checks from its state database, 
whether mobile SIM has been given access to management network.
# [How is this PULL asking triggered? In reality it is not asked, but
# changes are accepted from admin roles. How admin role is checked?]
CPE wants to verify, if the changes are authorized. They are, if currently
smartphone user is logged in management network, i.e. management is allowed.

# In production, some changes in cloud are propagated to home network via
# management network without need for extra authentication phase.  

In production, some changes in local controller are propagated to home network
via management network without need for an extra authentication phase.
The local controller does not interact there. An example of change is
a modification in network segment, which does not change network topology of other domains.
# Cha 4. last Section, "Lastly, variation of design is, that not
# every change needs to go
Those changes or alternatively changes that do need authorization
should be enumerated, which ever would be smaller set.  
# Q:Why enumeration needed? Why smaller set? 
# A: To explicit tell, when authorization is needed and rest can be
# left out. Alternatively, if free changes are only minimal (what are
# those? Invent. 
# I) Case: segment (device) owner makes modification inside own domain. No need
# to ask authentication from Network owner.
# II) CasE: segment owner wants to modify network topology change,
# which would add network segment belonging to someone else.
# )In our case the latter is smaller.
# Q: if almost every change needs to have authentication, then 
# free changes
# - enumeration ::  complete, ordered listing of all the items in a
#  collection.

In our model, only initial bootstrap needs the authentication with
smartphone as well as change of admin roles and some dangerous
combination of commands.

[ sync. part to misc Section ?]






Alternative method is that the changes could be marked some way, so that they need
approving and then there could be a specific change-approval message,
which must be sent through management network, perhaps including digest
of change message as a verification.

Because smartphone is not actively listening the CPE, it cannot input
those request. There are three planned ways to distribute changes.

1) Changes are delivered normally from cloud to CPE (CPEs) without
   interaction from the smartphone. Such changes would not need
   AA at all or changes include credentials to login to targets.

2) Changes are delivered from cloud to CPE functioning as a central
   management station without interaction from the smartphone.  Digest
   of what is going to happen would be sent to smartphone from BaaS
   over the air (OtA). Smartphone would authenticate in to management
   network (if not already there) and send through it the digest token
   it received from cloud as an approval message to central management
   station inside home network, which then forwards configuration changes
   to other devices.

3) Changes are delivered from cloud to smartphone, which after
   authenticating into management net, forwards them through management
   net to each and all devices.


# Let's assume, that changes are delivered normally
# from cloud to CPE direct without interaction from the smartphone. In
# case of authentication, messages are sent both to smartphone via radio
# channel [BaaS provides that?] and to CPE via normal IP messaging.
The smartphone may receive the authentication token with 
# (not authorization, but)
a message explaining what is going to happen in the change.
As the CPE and the Authenticator may be separate devices, approving
happens by sending the token from the smartphone to the CPE via the
management network where the Authenticator gives access.

It must be noted, that the smartphone can already have an association
to a non-management network with Wi-Fi. If that is the case, it first
must disconnect from there and then connect (i.e. AA) to the correct management
network. That implies disconnection from other services using Wi-Fi
link, because smartphones currently have only one Wi-Fi radio
available and routing would still prefer Wi-Fi as a default gateway, although
possible 3G data link still may stay operational.
# It is not tested, whether 3G-data link could be active still at the
# same time.
# 


** Chosen design and why (Rationale)
<<sec:chosendesign>>   
# segments
Network can be divided into separate segments based on user role and
needs, such as guest or home members segment. The segments provide
base connectivity layer and simple separation. Different
services, like disk storage, can force their own policy on application
level.
It is not defined, if the segmentation is made 
physical or virtual (VLAN, Virtual LAN). 
There is also a segment for devices management. 
An analogy to the real world would be public access corridors and doors for
customers separate from privileged doors for service personnel.


Routers control access to the segments with aid of 
# Access to the network segments is checked in routers with
access control lists (ACL), where decision is made based on current configuration or user's
role.  Once user has been authorized into management network, access
stays open for him, at least for a (predefined) limited time.

So, instead of checking user's credentials each time data is received
this model only checks, from where data is received. 
Data received from the management network is granted for changes.
It is arguable a lighter method than always
fully AuthN and AuthZ but may suffice here, at first.

# What have I thought here?
# -Naturally one will first challenge the solution, if
#  management network is thought to be in secured zone,
#  and devices need to have additional protection for logging in them. 

# then routers would have always management channel open.
# That is true, and so routers still need protection 
# by other means. Breaking one router would otherwise let open access to 
# every other router. But is that not then circular reasoning? 

Example of a complex solution would be a traditional firewall and packet
inspection in the interconnects, but very modern model
is the de-perimeterization trend set originally by Open Group's
Jericho Work Group in 2004, that won't leave trust verification to
perimeters of network (firewalls and application proxies) but 
always handles traffic as coming from untrusted source.\cite{jericho2004}
One implementation of de-perimeterization is 
Google's BeyondCorp\cite{2014-beyondcorp}, 
where all traffic always travels through Access Control Engine
and is suspected as being external, even when it originates from
inside networks. 
# That model is also called 
# de-perimeterization, while 
# it plays no role, where traffic comes,  from inside or outside 
# organization, it is always checked and authenticated.
# [;login; 2014 Dec. Vol. 39, No. 6(2014), pp. 6-11].



# (includes trust bind, which is also described on next Chapter, Section AuthZ with trust anchor...)
# [Tell in early phase, what solution has been chosen. Choose the one that was in abstract].  


# GOOD   trust bind
When home network needs secure binding to the smartphone, earlier
mentioned trust is the first one needed.  The trust is achieved by
checking whether the smartphone can access home management
network using only its trusted SIM-card, which provides AuthN. AuthZ in
turn is compared to existing roles of IMSI in the Authenticator.


[This has been explained in 802.1X Section in the begin. TBD]

Technically we use in Wi-Fi connection IEEE 802.11i (also known as WPA2), which includes
802.1X as port based access protocol.  802.11i defines there
authentication, authorization, and cryptography key agreement.
 It uses EAP for selecting authentication 
# explained already in Chapter (cha:aaa EAP)
mechanism, after Authenticator requests smartphone to identify itself as in Figure xxx is shown
Messages are carried over 802.1X or RADIUS depending on transport
medium as of Figure[[fig:eap-layers]].

# *** "provisioning of service": [combine :: v1 ::]

When AP forwards authentication request to next RADIUS server, it can
ask or receive, beside AuthN and AuthZ, other service parameters, such
as provisioning. That would allow the smartphone to connect to
specific management network access either via CLI or SNMP or
 similar\cite[p.4]{rfc5608}.  RADIUS can carry extra attributes in its
ACCESS-ACCEPT message.   In essence, AuthZ part itself can be thought as
one type of service provisioning. 


# Specific VLAN attributes can alternatively be delivered via
#  or similar ``getting into VLAN'' attribute
# if standard RADIUS messages do not suffice.  VSAs allow a vendor to use
# extra 255 attributes as they wish. 
There exists RADIUS attribute types for directing user into specific
VLAN. If those do not suffice, there is also special Vendor Specified
Attributes (VSA). VSAs allow vendors to define up to 255 own
attributes that can be used in provisioning in homogeneous environment. 


# [cite rfcXXX].  
That way (3rd party) Authentication server can decide which network
segment the device would be put.  In our case, admin users are put in
to the management network.  Yet, usually RADIUS ACCESS-ACCEPT message,
which means AuthN and AuthZ were successful,  puts the user in
default network, i.e., just gives it basic access. As for other
provisioning parameters, not all end devices support them.

In the first prototype it is enough to identify authorized
smartphone's SIM.  Smartphone holding the SIM is granted the access to
the parts of the management network and is authenticated strong.  User
management is outsourced to MNO, which
already has provided SIM cards to users. What remains, is the adding
of the user's IMSI to the authorized users' list. That list can be
located on diverse place, as can be seen in xxx
# ### 

# explain provisioning? 20150702

After authentication and authorization has succeeded, session key
creation occurs (WPA2 session) between AP and the smartphone. 
The Authenticator has opened port to the smartphone for
configuration changes. 
The Local RADIUS (if existing) has trails of successful
authentication and knows which IMSI has successfully authenticated in
the home net. It also knows mapping between IMSI and temporal IMSI for
cases where the smartphone later would need re-authentication.

In Behringers work-in-progress  bootstrapping\cite{draft-behringer-bootstrap},
AuthZ happens likewise first at cloud provider's
end, but after checking device's Vendor certificates, cloud provider
gives device a ticket of authorization like in Needham-Schröder or
Kerberos implementations. Device presents that ticket to CPE which
finally can decide, whether it allows change. 
Instead, here the Authentication server can be external RADIUS server,
but usually the final decision point lies at the Authenticator in CPE.

# * Theory Chapter: Managing Home Networks 


** Access methods to Wi-Fi with only one SSID

[To be cleaned!]

Today, home networks usually consists of only one Service Set ID (SSID)
Wi-Fi network though it is possible to define multiple SSIDs in
an access point. Having multiple SSIDs enables us to dedicate one of them
to management network. 
To enable EAP-SIM method, it is necessary to use WPA2-Enterprise mode
and thus RADIUS server.

# Two SSID, rationale
It was not found, how Authenticator could use the same network with
both WPA2-PSK (or open access) and WPA2-Enterprise, so
separate SSID for management network was technically needed.
# , while only management network is
# configured to use external RADIUS.  
# it was either WPA2-Enterprise (RADIUS) or WPA2-PSK for access.
If Wi-Fi was limited to only have one SSID, then we would need another
way to separate access requests to management net.  Access to Wi-Fi
can be separated by multiple realms (different username domains),
different authentication methods, or user's role
given by Authentication server. Management through Wi-Fi has then three
options.  Without RADIUS, access is open and the only checking comes
from the used management protocol and its access control.

[2015/05/11 NEW! This must be told everywhere, devices still have their own access
control! Or do they use RADIUS? Now RADIUS is used to carry on EAP auth to get into access
network, why not use it also to get in device? ]

With WPA2, PSK is used, but no EAP or RADIUS as a backend.  With EAP,
RADIUS server is the one who returns correct values to get in the
management network in ACCESS-ACCEPT message as was
explained in Section [[sec:chosendesign]].
# - Normal access, no RADIUS or just plain backend.
# - WPA2 Access, shared secret, no RADIUS 
# - PEAP access with whatever EAP outer-inner encapsulation
# encapsulation was explained on xxx

# *** Multirealms [ delete]
  
# [delete next paragraph] With multiple realms AuthN would be made on
# normal channel, if user represents himself as =username=, or
# =user@home= but on EAP-SIM, if user gives IMSI type id.  
#  [I think
# that authentication method is chosen before user have possibility to
# give any credentials.]  But remembering users choice of method,
# Authenticator can act differently: Either using external RADIUS or
# authenticating direct the user. One good usability issue is the one
# click access, where user clicks to choose Network and does not give
# any extra credentials, because SIM automatically feeds them. Still
# remember Swisscom [mentioned elsewhere].

 
*** HS2.0 [If deleted, remember also from conclusion! TBD]

It is well known, that the usability of the captive-portal Wi-Fi
 network is burden, because a user needs to go through 
a web portal logins with a username-password authentication 
procedure and those are different for every network.
Additionally, the user is often required to switch 
between cellular and  Wi-Fi data access when they change their location.

An industry brand  Hotspot 2.0 addresses those issues and tries to
simplify user's switch between Wi-Fi and cellular to automate the
roaming experience.  Hotspot 2.0 is driven by two alliances:
Wi-Fi Alliance has a certification program (Passpoint)
for Hotspot 2.0 compatible devices, while the Wireless Broadband
Alliance has a program called Next Generation Hotspot (NGH), targeted
to user experience\cite{wba-ngh}.

Hotspot 2.0
enables the selection of the network based on the ownership, services and
performance characteristics /before/ a Wi-Fi client has been associated
to a Hotspot 2.0 AP. The technology is built on IEEE 802.11u specification. 
In its second release version the operator would
have control on which network the smartphone would carry its data
transmission. 

#  and 802.11u specs. HS2.0 WPA2 has portions for this,
# maybe disabled.  


# One could guess, that Ownership, service and performance
# characteristics
# include 
# - ownership :: costs, money 
# - services :: sound, video, IP, printing, etc.
# - performance ::  speed and latency


In 2012 Ericsson's technology journal ``Review'', their 
HS2.0 goals were to make roaming between Wi-Fi and 3GPP/LTE networks smoother
and to bring operator-grade to Wi-Fi by putting control in operators side. More
than offloading traffic, plans were to bring other services also to Wi-Fi.\cite{er-seamless}

In Hotspot 2.0, the cellular network may signal the smartphone and
propose it to switch to Wi-Fi. The smartphone then would try to find a HS2.0 capable
access point and continue using Wi-Fi instead of cellular network.
In a similar way, the smartphone could receive signal from the cellular
network, when controlling changes need to be approved. The smartphone
would then make some tests to proof the local AP's suitability for 
HS2.0. If those succeed, then the cellular network would continue and order the 
phone to make a switch to the Wi-Fi network, authenticate there with 
EAP-SIM (or -AKA) and transfer services to Wi-Fi not forgetting 
the transfer in to the management network. This scenario could be 
studied further.


If HS2.0 was used here to automate the part, where
the smartphone needs to change from cellular to local
management Wi-Fi network and back, we probably would
miss the user decision part. The user, not the operator,
 must give his consent to access the management network, so
it is important, that the switch would not be automatic or forced.
In a way, operator aided roaming between Wi-Fi and cellular
works in a different level than here described trust-anchor method.
The operator is interested on the access network, while
we are interested in the side result of getting access, namely 
the achieved trusted access point.

** Scenarios for choosing the AuthZ location
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:scenarios
:END: 

# [Place of Authorization decision  ]

The AA components and the Authenticators can appear in 
diverse location combinations. Here the AuthN component 
always is located outside the home, as AuthN is the MNO.
The Authenticator or the AuthZ on the other hand
may be placed in the home or at the external provider.

# Analyzing the locations
AuthZ is usually checked from sources outside home, 
although the Authenticator is the one, who
gives the final decision about the access.

If the AuthZ-decision is made on remote AuthN server, 3rd party, 
then that server needs to have either local data or access to 
cloud service's AuthZ data (scenario III, external Authenticator).
Further it seems inevitable, that just like the home network model
in the cloud has  AuthZ data of eligible IMSI accounts,
then also delegating AuthZ function to the cloud would simplify home network 
management: instead of putting logic on CPE for AuthZ, CPE
could just trust the 3rd party service's AuthZ message, which in case
of RADIUS is either /ACCESS-ACCEPT/ or /ACCESS-REJECT/.


[Put the table after the scenarios?]

# This Chapter presents 5 scenarios for possible locations of AuthN and 
Table [[table-scenarios]] represents the locations for Authenticator (AA),
AuthN, and AuthZ in five scenarios. The locations are marked as (I)
for internal or (E) for external in the table and the scenarios are
described after that in detail. Authenticator is the entity which
gives the final decision about access regardless of location of AA.
In most cases it is located in the local AP, but it can also be
external, like in scenario III.

 MNO also asks from the Cloud, whether IMSI user has an admin role.
 MNO returns in RADIUS message either /ACCESS-ACCEPT/, if user is both

MNO returns in RADIUS message either /ACCESS-ACCEPT/, if

receives this ACCEPT or REJECT. If there were other RADIUSes between

In second scenario (Figure[[fig:scenario-II]]), AuthN is asked from MNO but
AuthZ is checked from local database. Local data comes from data model
i.e. from configuration data and will be saved in CPE, or some other
place within home network.

# *** Scenario III: AuthN and AuthZ from 3rd party, which uses MNO & BaaS
<<scenario-iii>>

Similar to first scenario is scenario III (Figure[[fig:scenario-III]]), 
but this time there is SP between CPE and MNO, so AA is fully outsourced:
local AP communicates with RADIUS protocol to the external
Authentication server. That in turn gets AuthN from MNO via its
hlr-auc-gateway and AuthZ from the cloud.
#  by CPE.
Locally there is a cache for roles in case of network disconnectivity.

Here benefit is, that 3rd party Authentication server may have direct
contracts to many alternative MNOs, so user does not need to find and choose
them. As a bonus,  MNOs already delegate requests to right operator, if
they happen to get AuthN request which does not belong to them.
This is similar to federated service.

Allowed users are verified from the cloud's registries and specific IMSI is
authenticated from MNO.  It may need some preparation, if SIM
identities are temporary i.e. TMSI is used.  Still, IMSI is carried out at first message
of full authentication. Later, the server would need to have mapping
between IMSI and TMSI, but because only full-authentication is used,
there should be no problem.

# *** Scenario IV: AuthN from MNO, AuthZ separate from BaaS.
<<scenario-iv>> 


Scenario IV (Figure[[fig:scenario-IV]]) is similar to scenario I, but
now AuthZ is checked by CPE instead of MNO from the Cloud. If there are no connection to
the cloud, the fall-back is to work just like II. So also this scenario needs local
store for caching admin IMSIs (Roles).

*** discussion about chosen model, simplification and further variations
[# variation for sending changes direct to CPE]

The simple way to propagate changes is make them come from the phone,
where an application takes care of sending them right to the end
devices. 

This simplification has pitfalls. If the smartphone continuosly stays
in the management network, how would later upcoming changes be
separated from currently approved.
# , i.e., the smart phone now is part of the trusted management network, but 
If we understood that the change approval belongs to the AA-process, then
the later approvals would also need an AA.

 The smartphone should either be dropped out from the management
network right away after the changes has been sent or after a
predefined timeout period during which more changes can be send.
That period can be called a management session.

The session time and the logout can be handled in AP directly with
an timer. After a specific time AP simple drops the connection
(WPA2-session) to the phone. This needs modification to the AP
software, if there already is not such method.
Other solution would be for AP to listen for a command from an external
AuthZ server, where similar timer would trigger a notification event.

If GBA architecture was chosen, then the smartphone would hold a 
token with validity time and must present that when accessing
services, here the management network. 
# If, on the other hand, the smartphone must send the changes itself, then it
# would be possible that the access in to the management network has short
# period of time, when phone holds that status or acceptance token. For
# example, during 10 minutes the connection would be open for changes. Then
# changes would not go directly to CPE but instead to X, but they would
# include some token to phone, which is needed for approval message.



# see automatic re-login issues
*** model of sending changes both to CPE and to the phone, which approves them
 While changes already have been  sent direct to the CPE and only let it
wait for approval, then when CPE receives ACCESS-ACCEPT, it could
proceed on propagating those changes.  Otherwise, after certain
timeout, CPE must stop waiting for phone's approval and drop changes.
#   [this was the question somewhere, ``triggering'']




# ** What prevents modifications of RADIUS messages? Securing message integrity.

** Ways to modify RADIUS messages [perhaps to security integrity chapter?]
<<sec:radius-macs>>
# [Analysis of RADIUS, RADIUS Proxies..
RADIUS messages are not protected from eavesdropping, but they have
integrity fields to notice if tampering has been done.  
Integrity field is called a Message Authenticator.
Notice the use of the term /Authenticator/ in different context here, not
meaning 802.1X's Authenticator.
When using RADIUS to AuthN and AuthZ, Requests can only belong to ACCESS-REQUEST messages while
Responses can be any of ACCESS-ACCEPT, ACCESS-REJECT, or ACCESS-CHALLENGE message.
The Message Authenticator field is sent as last Attribute Value Pair (AVP)
of each RADIUS message and it can belong 
to either Request or Response.\cite[p.20]{radiusbook}.

# Random value is used in /Request/ Authenticators and  
# MD5 hash in /Response/ Authenticators.
The Request Authenticator is 16 octet long, random number in
ACCESS-REQUEST message but the Response Authenticator for it is achieved
by one-way MD5 digestion function. 
The digest is taken from concatenation of Code, ID, Length, corresponding
Request\-Auth, Attributes, and a Secret and can look like 
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
$3fef65608\ldots 2a79$. 
\begin{verbatim}
 Response Authenticator = 
     MD5(Code |ID |Length |Request Authenticator |Attributes |Secret)
\end{verbatim}
#+END_LaTeX
The Secret is the shared secret which has been configured between RADIUS servers,
and it protects some parts of traffic. 
Different RADIUS clients may have different
secrets and RADIUS server must separate them by client's IP address to
manage proxied RADIUS requests\cite{radiusbook}.
If the user password was to be transmitted on wire, it would be run
through exclusive OR function (XOR) together with MD5 digested Secret
and Request
Authenticator.
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{center}
{\tt 
User-Password = XOR(password, MD5(Secret | Request Authenticator))}
\end{center}
#+END_LaTeX

# they would be MD5 digested and run through
# with those RADIUS shared secrets.


Our model would greatly benefit from modification of RADIUS messages in proxying
RADIUS, if that is possible as was mentioned in Section [[sec:radius]](RADIUS).
The modification is needed when proxying RADIUS combines AuthN message
from MNO to AuthZ decision received from elsewhere.

# [ ALT: Is it possible for proxying RADIUS to insert or modify
# authorization information on authentication reply i.e. in the
# ACCESS-ACCEPT? ] [see. 2.1]

# extensions 6927. "if not understood, some proxy servers deny
# forwarding. Instead, non-understood values should be regarded as 
# strings, and deliver messages



# , so at least it can insert something.

#
RFC6929\cite{rfc6929} reminds, that even when
the proxies do not understand all AVPs inside RADIUS message, they
must deliver those values and that allows us to use larger set of AVPs 
than is in any (proxying) RADIUS server's vocabulary.
By adding AVPs inside the authorization packet, we achieve extra
information about validity of the access request.
That information may include VLAN parameter or time of forced
logout.
# that the access point and smartphone would later need.
RFC2865\cite{rfc2865} says, that the forwarding RADIUS proxy may alter
the packet as it passes it, but because an alteration would invalidate the
packet's signature, the proxy has to re-sign the packet.



# RFC2865 \cite{rfc2865} says, that: [TBD, digest this]
# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
# When using a forwarding proxy, the proxy must be able to alter the
#       packet as it passes through in each direction - when the proxy
#      forwards the request, the proxy MAY add a /Proxy-State
#      Attribute/, and when the proxy forwards a response, it MUST
#      remove its /Proxy- State/ Attribute if it added one.
#      Proxy-State is always added or removed after any other
#      Proxy-States, but no other assumptions regarding its location
#      within the list of attributes can be made.  Since ACCESS-ACCEPT
#      and ACCESS-REJECT replies are authenticated on the entire packet
#      contents, the stripping of the Proxy-State attribute invalidates
#      the signature in the packet - so the proxy has to re-sign it.
#
#      Further details of RADIUS proxy implementation are outside the
#      scope of this document.
# #+END_QUOTE
# [source https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2865]

So at least Proxying RADIUS can insert something, but that is not
enough.  If a malicious actor imitates RADIUS Proxy (i.e. Man in the
middle, MiTM), it can try to inject untruthful messages. 
Message Authenticator with MD5 digesting
might help in detecting those attacks,
Unfortunately MD5 can not be thought computationally
secure, because duplicate hashes are easy to compute
today\cite{xie2013fast}.
MD5 hashes were first time broken by brute force
already 20 years ago and today they can only be used as data error
detection tool\cite[p.2]{rfc6151}.

The method is very similar to the concept used on routers to dynamically enable
access to certain parts of network by first letting the user to log in
to the router. If the access succeeds, the router dynamically adds
route to the management (or other restricted) part from the 
users network.

access and uses dynamic access list to implement it.

Figure [[fig:cisco-802.1x]] reminds us again how 802.1X works.

protects IP-access in layer-3 and though needs IP addressing, while
802.1x's protection starts already at layer-2 between the smart phone
and AP. Captive portals are similar to Lock-And-Key.
# Difference here is that 802.1X protects access to the network already in Layer
# 2 while Lock-and-Key needs to first have a functional Layer 3 to conduct
# authentication phase. 


Both methods, 802.1X and Lock-and-Key (and captive portals) can have RADIUS as an Authentication server. 
When RADIUS is not available, for example because internet is down,
there almost always exist as a failover a local password method in the configurable 
router.

[This belongs to multiple SSID section]

If Lock-and-key method was used instead of EAP-SIM RADIUS, then
separate manage\-ment LAN would not be needed. Roles were given at
Authentication server or designated router after the smartphone has done login to it
via normal access network.



This thesis suggests a mix of these methods: EAP-SIM 802.1x WPA2 for
authenticating in the local network with SIM and
Lock-and-key type modification in the AP to further access the 
management network. Finally, RADIUS protocol is used to transfer 
parameters, that the smartphone would need in communicating with 
devices in need of changes.

** Summary of the chosen solution

[wrap up of solution]

The chosen solution to benefit from SIM is via EAP-profiles, as EAP
is well known when using WPA2-Enterprise protection in Wi-Fi.

Design is [move from above]...
and it is a variation of lock-and-key design.
# Abbreviation ..

Above it was mentioned, that the local controller delivers changes to each
device. 
On this work, it is first assumed that the local controller (smart
phone) only /approves/ changes,
# which are already delivered 
and delivers them to /one, central CPE/, 
which handles distribution of changes to other CPEs. The distribution
is not further described. 
Later, the Authenticator is both the AP and
RADIUS client (in scenarios I-V), which receives RADIUS messages from
Authentication server, even when there would be a separate local RADIUS server
running as a proxy.
Lastly, a variation of the design is, that not every change needs to go
 through  the local controller and so the process does not always need
interaction from the user. For example, if 3rd party has been given 
a right to switch on and off its sensor network, it would not be 
necessary for the home owner to accept those changes every time they occur.


# - define perhaps what changes need authentication and thus passthru

Critical changes are those, where network topology changes so much,
that different players would get access outside their earlier domains.
Different players include external service providers, users at home,
visitors, and also home network owner. Examples of the previous cases can first be
seen on the division of home network to guest and private network and
extensions for homeworkers instead of office.



# division of 

*** discussion about chosen model, simplification and further variations
[# variation for sending changes direct to CPE]

The simple way to propagate changes is make them come from the phone,
where an application takes care of sending them right to the end
devices. 

This simplification has pitfalls. If the smartphone continuosly stays
in the management network, how would later upcoming changes be
separated from currently approved.
# , i.e., the smart phone now is part of the trusted management network, but 
If we understood that the change approval belongs to the AA-process, then
the later approvals would also need an AA.

 The smartphone should either be dropped out from the management
network right away after the changes has been sent or after a
predefined timeout period during which more changes can be send.
That period can be called a management session.

The session time and the logout can be handled in AP directly with
an timer. After a specific time AP simple drops the connection
(WPA2-session) to the phone. This needs modification to the AP
software, if there already is not such method.
Other solution would be for AP to listen for a command from an external
AuthZ server, where similar timer would trigger a notification event.

If GBA architecture was chosen, then the smartphone would hold a 
token with validity time and must present that when accessing
services, here the management network. 
# If, on the other hand, the smartphone must send the changes itself, then it
# would be possible that the access in to the management network has short
# period of time, when phone holds that status or acceptance token. For
# example, during 10 minutes the connection would be open for changes. Then
# changes would not go directly to CPE but instead to X, but they would
# include some token to phone, which is needed for approval message.

# see automatic re-login issues
*** model of sending changes both to CPE and to the phone, which approves them
 While changes already have been  sent direct to the CPE and only let it
wait for approval, then when CPE receives ACCESS-ACCEPT, it could
proceed on propagating those changes.  Otherwise, after certain
timeout, CPE must stop waiting for phone's approval and drop changes.
#   [this was the question somewhere, ``triggering'']

#    adding visitor access etc)
# - Message sequences

To prove that the proposed model works, empirical tests have been done.
First it is shown how EAP-SIM authentication works in a simulated
environment.
 Then a use case for disconnection is reported and network traces analyzed.
# for adding an admin user is reported.
 Changes are in the end done 
# for example (with SSH or)
with NETCONF from the management network.

Used physical devices were two smartphones, an AP and a laptop.
The smartphones were Nokia E70-1 and Nokia E90, both capable of EAP-SIM.
The AP was running OpenWRT firmware.  
Laptop's software was WPA2-Supplicant for Wi-Fi 802.1X access,
hostapd for wired connected RADIUS server and hlr_auc_gw for MNO's
HLR-AuC. Laptop's role was therefore physically split-brain: It asked from itself for AA. 
Figure[[eap-sim-testbed]] shows how EAP-SIM AuthN messages (dashed
and solid arrowed lines) flow when using 
simulated WPA2-Supplicant and HLR-AuC as simulation environment.
# Logically the model can be better described in figure[[eap-sim-testbed]].

Jouni Malinen's software package /HostAP/\cite{hostapd} can be thought
 as a reference
implementation providing all necessary components: WPA2-Supplicant, Wireless
Access point (AP), HLR-gateway (for GSM networks) and EAP-endpoint with
or without RADIUS-server. HSS would replace HLR in 3G/UMTS networks.
The version used in the tests was 2.2, while version
