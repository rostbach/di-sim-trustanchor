- re-auth for long-lived sessions or if there is cost for disrupting them
- APs provide different authentication suites for different 
SSIDs

** using EAP for other than network access, i.e., for application auth.

- application as an EAP peer

** eap-psk rfc4764.txt
- other limitations than identity protection are password support and Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
- eap-psk
- only 3 standards track EAP methods per IETF terminology,
but all of them are deprecated (md5,OTP,GTC ja?)
- some EAP- o  Essentially require additional infrastructure, e.g., EAP-SIM [24],
      EAP-AKA [12], or OTP/token card methods like [31].


** eap-sim acts similar than any other EAP challenge method (or not?)
- compare eap-sim with other method and point out differences.
- privacy already shown
- user defined passwd? 
- how many messages needed? In eap-sim 6+1 (success/failure)
- to do comparison, I have to study how EAP in general works
- Authenticator for example can use either local method or
  pass-through the authentication to external backend, still keeping
  EAP-message in tact(sp?) as of  rfc4137
- WPA2 package's hostapd from JM does not perhaps provide EAP-PEAPv0
  SIM but wpa-supplicant supports.
# - EAP-SIM symmetric vs asymmetric parts 
# - Can dual-SIM card be used? It has two physical devices, both ring
#  at the same time, do they have mobiilivarmenne?
# no clouds here
# ** Cloud‐based services
# ** More attacks from literature, not categorized 
# - dictionary and brute force not valid in EAP-AKA (rfc4187)
# - key size 128 or 64? (see paper on key size ``only 64bit, not 192bit'')
 - VLAN itself has an attack vector and some methods exists, but also
  mitigation for them. 
 - rad Authenticator, TLS, RADSEC etc, needs both client and server in
   x509 certificate
# - Easily physically accessible devices are vulnerable to physical attacks.

# ** Second option for multirealms 
# Second option for multirealms is to use EAP-SIM or relatives (PEAP)
# _with user configurable_ User and Domain parameters (-> pseudonym
# protection). As default, identity is read from SIM application (from
# card).
